# My Valentine Proposal Website

Welcome to my little Valentine's Day project! ðŸŒ¹

This is a simple web app I built using Flask, where I ask someone special to be my Valentine. The idea is to let her respond to my proposal, and the answer will be saved in a database (which is cool because it means Iâ€™ll always know her answer). Itâ€™s deployed on Render, so she can see it live. 

**I built this as a fun and creative way to propose and show her how much she means to me. ðŸ˜Š**

## Features

- A heartfelt landing page with a Valentine proposal.
- A response page where the special someone can submit their answer.
- A thank you page to show after submitting the response (because every answer deserves a "thank you").
- An admin page (for me) where I can check all the responses that come through!

## Requirements

Before you try running this on your own, here's what you'll need:

- Python 3.x (donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s easy to install)
- Flask (for the web app)
- Gunicorn (to run the app in production)
- SQLite (where the responses are safely stored)
